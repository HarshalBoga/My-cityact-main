# MyCity Act.

Implementation of a platform to Solve Civic-related problems.

Proposed project is an automated system which will provide a better tech assistantship for handling various civic problems in an efficient way. 

Our project will provide a common platform for Citizens, Authorities and the Ground Level Workers who are responsible for implementation of commands.


## Tech Stack

**Tech used:** Android, Firebase Authentication and Database, Firebse ML Kit, JShell.




## Features

- Camera and location based problem posting.
- Can upvote, downvote and comment on other posts.
- Can post notices and other useful info.



## Challenges Faced

One flaw in our existing system was whether the workers who are expected to complete the work given to them are actually completing their work and uploading the actual image after work completion or they are uploading any other fraud image.

Hence, we came up with a solution that we will allow the users to post two types of post:

Type 1 – Which will solve the problem discussed above by asking only Camera permission and not Gallery permission which will ensure that the workers will upload the actual image after completing the task.

Type 2 – Where people are asked to give both gallery and camera permission so that they can upload posters or banners about any program , donation drive , blood donation camps etc.
